      "Insanity can’t be measured, but 12,000 rpm is a start. Our engine has descended from classic motorsport and resurrected for one purpose - to satisfy an obsession with excessive revolutions and aural pleasure. Surprise B!tch*s, we did not expect to love an electric powertrain. Ever. But maniacs don’t have rules! Our electric experience will make history proud - bringing wheel-melting power, chaos and an intoxicating driving experience. Pick Thunder or Lightning? No wrong answers here. *Pre-production images shown.",

      "How do you design a car unhinged from time and space? Start by building a time machine. Go back to the savage beginnings, channel that spirit, and forever change what lies ahead. We exorcised boredom, replaced with unfiltered nostalgia and modern minimalism. Pure fun in the maddest way possible. We have forged a timeless machine; free of trends, decoration and faddish styling. The undefinable HF-11, your limitless steed chasing velocity. *Pre-production images shown.",

      "The HF-11 is full psycho about aerodynamic performance and aesthetic purity. We lost our minds in the mission to never compromise. Resulting in a proportion that is foreign yet immediately understandable. In the back, the guts of the massive powertrain are rebelliously exposed. Pronounced fenders shroud the wide tires and declare war on static air, the body side is sculpted to cojole the air towards the massive ground effects and hidden rear wing, ripping downforce unto the ground. Just like the air, you’ll know when it’s here. *Pre-production images shown.",

A place to be a version of yourself not everyone can understand. Designed for rapturous performance, supported by motorsports-tested ergonomics. Available in any custom spec a maniac could dream up. Everything a driving obsessive could want, distilled to a potent minimalism. The perfect place to lose your mind. *Pre-production images shown.",

In the meantime, we’ve got our eye on every observable detail of the HF-11. Nothing is taken at face value, every component is interrogated, every function must dovetail perfectly with all others in an impossible pursuit of mechanical singularity. The devil’s never seen details like these. *Pre-production images shown.",

They wake up possessed by the eternal battle of weight versus speed, handling and efficiency. They stop at nothing to cut grams, hunting aerospace grade pre-preg carbon, insanely light, insanely strong. They fire it in an autoclave to elevate quality, strength and weight savings. And still, they cannot sleep at night. *Pre-production images shown",
